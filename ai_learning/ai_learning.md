# AI learning

AI/ML is a diverse field, and it is important to actively select and learn the topics that are relevant to our teams. We identify the areas and topics in three parts: AI/ML foundation, Generative AI, and AI systems.

Here are the summaries of the topics in the three parts:

- AI/ML foundation: Foundational knowledge for ML (Machine learning) and DL (Deep learning) and applications that are related to our team.
- Generative AI: Overview of generative AI and LLM (Large language model), and how to use them in applications and systems.
- AI/ML systems: AI accelerators, compute, systems in AI systems training and inference, and LLM inference.

## Topics

### Part 1. AI/ML foundation
